# Lawful - a text-based hacking game.
  
Game is in very early stages of being ported from its prior rendition at cvp28/LawfulGame.  
Currently porting the entire game to work on the Haven Console Library.  
  
Running the game will involve pulling Haven and Lawful into their own separate directories and compiling both manually.  
Lawful is setup to use the Release binary for Haven.
