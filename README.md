# Lawful - a text-based hacking game.
  
Game is in somewhat early stages of being ported from its prior rendition at cvp28/LawfulGame.  
Currently porting the entire game to work on the Haven Console Library.  
  
Game comes with the latest build of Haven included in the repository root.  
Everything is all hooked up - all that needs to be done to run the development build of the game is to launch the .sln in visual studio and compile it manually.  
The Haven DLL includes embedded debug data.
